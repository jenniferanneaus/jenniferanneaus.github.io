Jennifer has been living in Melbourne since 2018, when she completed her Honours year in Mathematics. During her Honours year, she wrote C++ programs to aid her research project *Hadamard matrices and their generalisations*. Jennifer was awarded the 2018 Carl Moppert Prize for best overall Mathematics Honours student at Monash University.

Prior to living in Melbourne, Jennifer lived in Tasmania where she studied Computer Science and Pure Mathematics at university. She has subsequently worked for the University of Tasmania as a Software Developer, and taught Mathematics and Computer Science to senior secondary students. She has also worked as a Teaching Associate at Monash University, where she tutored and assessed units in Mathematics and Engineering.

The purpose of this blog is to demonstrate examples of the projects Jennifer has worked on since leaving university. The website was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Jasper2's port](https://github.com/jekyller/jasper2) of Ghost's Casper theme.
